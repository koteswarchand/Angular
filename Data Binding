------------------------------------------ DATA BINDING-------------------------------------------------
Data binding - communication between a typescript file and a html template
generally without data binding html template is static, with data binding we can add some dynamic features to out html template
Two types of data binding 1.One way binding 2.Two way binding
-----One Waybinding------
in one way binding the communicaton is uni directional at a time
for example, the ts file will communicate with html template  but html does not communicate with ts during this commincation due uni directionalat a time  or 
html file will commincate with ts file, but not ts does not communicate with html file  during this communication.
-----Two wat binding------
the communication is multidirectional
the ts file can bind data to html file and in return ts receives a response from html file 
Types in One way binding
1.String interpolation, 2.propery binding
-------String interpolation-------
String interpolation is used to replace a string/ print out a string/ output a string
String interpolation can be impleted with double curly braces - {{ string_word }}
example - in appmodules.ts a string varibale name has a value of john, this name should be printed in the html page without hard coding

In appmodule.ts 
//declare a string variable
name = "John";
In app.component.html
//string interpolation
<h2>Name : {{ name }} </h2>
 
 this is how string interpolation is implemented in angular
  {{ name }} - inside the curly braces we should pass a string or a data type that is convertable to string or a method that returns string
